# Eye_Blinking_System
A real-time eye blink detection system built using Python and OpenCV. The project uses a live webcam feed to detect facial landmarks and identify eye blinks, which can be useful for drowsiness detection, human–computer interaction, and accessibility applications.
This project implements a real-time eye blink detection system using computer vision techniques. It captures live video from a webcam, detects faces and eyes, and identifies blinking patterns using facial landmarks. The system demonstrates practical applications of OpenCV and Python in computer vision–based monitoring systems.
